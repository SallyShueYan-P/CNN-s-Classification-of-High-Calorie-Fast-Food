# CNN-s-Classification-of-High-Calorie-Fast-Food
In the digital era, making informed dietary decisions is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Our project introduces an automated food recognition system that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately detect and classify food items in photos. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we aim to enhance efficiency, promote healthier eating habits, and provide valuable insights into nutritional intake.

Traditional methods for food detection often lack accuracy and effectiveness due to the diverse appearances and subtle differences between food items. In contrast, CNNs have proven to be highly successful in image recognition tasks. Our project focuses on fast food items, curating a comprehensive dataset of 31,500 images covering popular items such as burgers, donuts, pizza, and more.

Through training our model with this dataset, we aim to achieve exceptional accuracy in food detection and classification. Users can capture photos of their meals, and our system will identify the specific fast food item depicted. Additionally, the system will provide insights into the nutritional aspects of the recognized food items, alerting users to the top 3 highest-calorie choices.

This project bridges the gap between technology and nutrition, combining computer vision techniques, deep learning, and food science. The automated food recognition system not only benefits individuals in monitoring their nutritional intake but also serves as a valuable tool for health-conscious individuals, nutritionists, and dietary researchers. As an open-source initiative, we welcome collaborative contributions to further enhance and refine food recognition technology.
