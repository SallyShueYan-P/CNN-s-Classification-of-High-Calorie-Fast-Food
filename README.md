# CNN-s-Classification-of-High-Calorie-Fast-Food
 Our CNN project focuses on leveraging convolutional neural networks to accurately detect and classify food items in photos, with a specific goal of identifying the top 3 highest-calorie fast foods. By utilizing a dataset of 31,500 images, we aim to overcome the challenges posed by the similarity in shape, size, and color of various food products.
